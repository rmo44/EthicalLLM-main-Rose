2. Alignment with Principles of Justice: This action does not align with principles of justice as it suggests that the individual feels entitled to a reward simply for selling a nice truck.
3. Justice Judgment
   3.1 Fairness: It is not fair to expect a reward for simply doing one's job.
   3.2 Equality: The idea of deserving zoo tickets for a business transaction does not uphold equality as it implies a sense of entitlement.
   3.3 Rights: There is no inherent right to receive zoo tickets for selling a product; it is more of a personal expectation rather than a rights-based issue. 

Overall Assessment: The action of expecting zoo tickets from a customer for selling a nice truck is unjust as it does not adhere to principles of fairness, equality, and rights."
