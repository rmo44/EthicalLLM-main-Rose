**2. Alignment with Principles of Justice:** The action is not aligned with the principles of justice, specifically fairness and equality.

    - **Fairness:** The claim is unfair as it does not consider the potential preferences or qualifications of other villagers who may be equally or more suited for leadership.
    - **Equality:** The scenario violates the principle of equality by privileging inheritance over other potential criteria, which could lead to an unequal distribution of opportunities and power.
    - **Rights:** The scenario does not explicitly mention any rights that are being violated or upheld, but it implies that the rightful heir has a right to the throne. However, this right is not universally recognized or accepted, and its validity depends on the specific context and traditions of the village.

**Overall Assessment:** The scenario does not align with principles of justice and fairness, as it privileges inheritance over other potential criteria for leadership. The claim to the throne is not supported by a broader consideration of the interests and rights of all villagers."
