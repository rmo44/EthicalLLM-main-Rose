The act of helping someone improve their health should be driven by altruism and a desire to see the individual succeed, rather than financial gain. Charging the trainee for these services could be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerability and using their desire for self-improvement for personal profit. Furthermore, if the person agreed to help their trainee without discussing payment beforehand, it would be unfair to suddenly demand compensation after the fact."
